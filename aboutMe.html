        Hello, I am Lola. <br>
        I'm 25 years old and I've been interested <br>
        in taking photos since I was a 12-year-old <br>
        little pre-teen.
      <br> <br>
      For most part, I've been taking photos of <br>
      myself and my closed ones. Once I've had the <br>
      chance to travel more, I've also been trying <br>
      to capture moments more and more. 
      <br><br>
      Photography has been an on-and-off hobby for <br>
      me, but lately it's been feeling more like a <br>
      passion than a hobby. 
      <br><br>
      If there is anything you should learn from <br>
      photography. I do believe, it's to see beauty <br>
      in everything, from traditional to unconventional.<br>
      From yourself to other people. From nature to <br>
      man-made things.
      <br><br>

    </p>

    <p class="aboutme">

      I enjoy discovering and trying out new DIY <br>
      photography ideas and then try to adapt <br>
      the new skills to making videos as well.
      <br> <br>
      I've mostly dabbled in making videos <br>
      for my own social media, but <br>
      I've considered trying to make content <br>
      for other people or businesses too.
      <br><br>
      So far the only obstacle with taking all <br>
      of this further is the lack of equipment. <br>
      Luckily, that forces one to be creative.
      <br><br>
      It's important to surround yourself with<br>
      people who inspire you and want to see you <br>
      do well in whatever you are doing.

      A little bit more about me. <br>
      I'm an Early Childhood Education teacher <br>
      as well as a receptionist at a hotel front office.
      <br> <br>
      I am currently a freshman studying <br>
      Business Information Technology at Haaga-Helia<br>
      University of Applied Sciences.
      <br><br>
      I find it important to keep learning<br>
      new skills and getting outside of one's comfort <br>
      zone. Whether it is an entirely new career or <br>
      something simpler, like going to the cinema alone.
